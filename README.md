# Expert Diagnostic System 
The expert diagnostic system uses the java expert shell system which is a routine of commands used to create an intelligent system. 
Using the CLIPS editor (and extension of JESS rules), it uses intelligent behaviour to determine the problem with a typical business computer program by allowing the user to determine what the issue is.
